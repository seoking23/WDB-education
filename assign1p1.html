  <p>The main character of hit American animated cartoon series <b>Adventure Time</b>, supported by the
    networks of cartoon network and animation studio Pendleton Ward. Finn the Human is a 12 year old boy
    who adventures through the fantastic land of ooo. A savior to the innocent and punisher of evil, he accomplishes
    great feats that could only dawn him the title of being a hero.</p>
      <h2>The lost child</h2>
      <p>With only his lifetime best friend and proclaimed brother <strong>Jake the Dog</strong> as his main familial support system,
      this magical, stretchy and shape contorting yellow dog only brings more mystery to the story of Finn the Human.
      Although the land is sparsely populated with humanoid creatures ranging from: 
        <ul>
            <li>the candy princess, and big time girlboss, <b>Princess Bubblegum</b></li>
            <li>her citzens of the candy kingdom (which she synthesized from her own magic candy flesh)</li>
            <li>demon-vampire princess subtly, but not so subtly daddy-issued queer icon <b>Marcelline</b></li> 
            <li>to a kidnapping, derranged, borderline pedophilic <b>Ice King</b></li> 
            <li>and many many more.</b></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
      But one thing we never see.. is another human. Finn the Human, is the last remaining human in the entire world.</p>
